# Welcome to Flappy Bird Fit!

## Purpose

Flappy Bird Fit was created to help gamers get exercise while having fun playing classics like Flappy Bird. 

The project used yoloV8's Object Detection Model, found on Github, credits to DAVIDNYARKO123 @ https://github.com/DAVIDNYARKO123/yolov8-silva, combined with a GUI based on Pygame. Flappy Bird Fit has four difficulties, a broad soundtrack and adjustable frame rate to fit your needs.

NOTE: Make sure when playing only one person is in frame of the camera, or Flappy Bird Fit won't function as intended.

### Third Party Packages
Python, Ultralytics, Pygame, Pygame.camera

## Usage
1. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run Main.py, select your camera, difficulty, frame rate if needed, and enjoy Flappy Bird Fit!
